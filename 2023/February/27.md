## OpenSSL s_client SNI error

In trying to get the common name from an IPv4 address, knowing that the host is listening on port 443, and running:

```bash
xargs -I {} sh -c "openssl s_client -connect \"{}:443\" 2>/dev/null </dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^subject.*CN=//'"
```

I got `invalid2.invalid` following the sed processing. This is because openssl had the following output:

```
No SNI provided; please fix your client
```

This has to do with the TLS version used during the TLS handshake. Setting TLS to 1.2 helped:

```
xargs -I {} sh -c "openssl s_client -connect "{}:443" -tls1_2 2>/dev/null </dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject 2>/dev/null | sed "s/^subject.*CN=//"
```

I don't understand why this was heppening exactly, but perhaps it's because the server claims to support TLS 1.3 (I suppose TLS 1.3 is negotiated by default?), but this error occured when initiating the TLS connection. By the way, the domain ended up being `googlecode.com`.
