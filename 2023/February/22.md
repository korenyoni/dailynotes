### Birth of the Daily Notes Repo

Today marks the birth of the daily notes repository.

A cool project that I ran into is https://github.com/technote-space/toc-generator. I initially wanted to use it to generate a ToC for all of the subdirectories (i.e. years, months), but doctoc only cares about subsections in the markdown file. In either case it doesn't really matter, because you can see the folder structure in the GitHub tree. So if it were to be in the README as well, it would be redundant. This GitHub action is a little "too smart", because it handles both the checkout, commit, push, and even PR. And I'm used to handling all of those in separate steps (i.e. using the official checkout action, and also EndBug/add-and-commit).

Another thing I didn't really use before was https://picsum.photos/. I'm using the seed functionality, with the date as the seed, so that the same image is returned every time you open the note for that given day.

#### "Spoofing" the `date` command

I also used the [HebCal API](https://www.hebcal.com/home/195/jewish-calendar-rest-api) to get the Prasha of the week, if it's a saturday.

In order to test this, I needed to manipulate the date. There is a bit of a difference on how you would do this on Mac vs on Linux.

The BSD implementation of `date` accepts a `-v` flag, which allows you to manipulate the date. For example, to get the date for 3 days from now, you would do `date -v+3d`. The GNU implementation of `date` does not have this flag, so you would have to do something like `date -d "+3 day"`.

So what I did was create an alias for `date` via `alias date="date -d '+3 day'"'`

```bash
alias date="date -d '+3 day'" # TODO: remove (for testing)
if [[ $(date +%A) == "Saturday" ]]; then
  SHABBAT=$(cat << EOF
### $(curl https://www.hebcal.com/hebcal\?v\=1\&cfg\=json\&s\=on\&year\=now\&start\=$(date +%Y)-$(date +%m)-$(date +%d)\&end\=$(date +%Y)-$(date +%m)-$(date +%d)\&geo\=none\&s\=on | jq -r '.items[].title')
:candle: :candle: :bread: :bread: :wine_glass:
EOF
  )
fi
```

#### Bash Aliases in GitHub Actions

I ran into an issue where I was trying to use an alias in a GitHub action, and it was not being adhered.

It turns out that since the shell in GitHub Actions [is not interactive, the aliases are not loaded](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/766#issuecomment-928305811). So you have to explicitly load them in the script:

```bash
shopt -s expand_aliases # TODO: remove (for testing)
alias date="date -d '+3 day'" # TODO: remove (for testing)
```
