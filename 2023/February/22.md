### Birth of the Daily Notes Repo

Today marks the birth of the daily notes repository.

A cool project that I ran into is https://github.com/technote-space/toc-generator. I initially wanted to use it to generate a ToC for all of the subdirectories (i.e. years, months), but doctoc only cares about subsections in the markdown file. In either case it doesn't really matter, because you can see the folder structure in the GitHub tree. So if it were to be in the README as well, it would be redundant. This GitHub action is a little "too smart", because it handles both the checkout, commit, push, and even PR. And I'm used to handling all of those in separate steps (i.e. using the official checkout action, and also EndBug/add-and-commit).

Another thing I didn't really use before was https://picsum.photos/. I'm using the seed functionality, with the date as the seed, so that the same image is returned every time you open the note for that given day.

Once thing I haven't gotten around to just yet, is to use the HebCal API to retrieve the name of the Prasha of the week, if the day is Shabbat (see: https://www.hebcal.com/home/195/jewish-calendar-rest-api), where I won't be posting notes unless I for some reason need to on Saturday night, when Shabbat ends. It should be easy to do actually, and would be a nice touch to this repo.
