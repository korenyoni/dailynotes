## Running Nuclei Tests on all Endpoints Listed by OpenAPI

If your endpoint uses OpenAPI, you can check every (get) endpoint for vulnerabilities as follows:

```bash
DOMAIN=https://example.com; \
        curl $DOMAIN/api/openapi.json \
        | yq -P '.paths[] | select(.get != null) | map(parent | key) | .[]' \
        | sed "s/{[^}]*}/$(openssl rand -hex 10)/g" | xargs printf "$DOMAIN/api%s\n" \
        | nuclei -t ~/software/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/vulnerabilities/generic/cors-misconfig.yaml
```
