    # As the name suggests, the workflow is designed to run daily.
    # However, the workflow itself is idempotent, so it's safe to run it more often.
    # I would prefer that the workflow runs once an hour, and by virtue of its
    # idempotency, only create one new daily note, than run exactly once a day
    # and possibly fail to generate the daily note.
