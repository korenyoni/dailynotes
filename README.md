# Daily Notes

[![.github/workflows/daily-note.yaml](https://github.com/korenyoni/dailynotes/actions/workflows/daily-note.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=schedule)](https://github.com/korenyoni/dailynotes/actions/workflows/daily-note.yaml)

Day-to-day notes on the things I'm learning. I've been at this for more than a decade, but I'm still learning.

Note placeholders are generated daily, though it is not guaranteed that I will fill out each day.

Topics of interest include:

* AWS (usually things that pop up in my day job)
* Kubernetes
* Pentesting (things learned from CTFs)
* Programming (most likely Golang, due to the CNCF ecosystem)
* Anything else that comes up
